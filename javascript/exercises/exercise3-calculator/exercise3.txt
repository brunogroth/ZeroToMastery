// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var firstnumber = prompt("insert your first number here");
var secondnumber = prompt("insert your second number here");
var sum = Number(firstnumber) + Number(secondnumber);
var sub = Number(firstnumber) - Number(secondnumber);
var div = Number(firstnumber) / Number(secondnumber);
var mult= Number(firstnumber) * Number(secondnumber);
alert("The sum of these numbers are " + sum + " | The subtraction of these numbers are " + sub + " | The multiply of these numbers are " + mult + " | The division of these numbers are " + div);
